## About me

I am currently on an exciting journey with AWS Restart, eager to build a solid foundation in cloud computing. I’m passionate about technology and always curious to learn how things work behind the scenes. I enjoy exploring new cloud solutions, collaborating on team projects, and tackling challenging problems.

My interests include cloud architecture, automation, and finding innovative ways to use AWS services to solve real-world problems. I love connecting with others who share a similar enthusiasm for IT, and I’m always open to learning from different perspectives. Outside of tech, I enjoy reading, music, and spending time outdoors.

I’m looking forward to growing my skills, earning certifications, and starting a rewarding career in cloud computing!
